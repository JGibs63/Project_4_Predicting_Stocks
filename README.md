# Project_4_Predicting_Stocks

Starting Out:
We started this Project wanting to predict the stock prices for stocks because it would offer an opportunity for us to delve into the exciting combination of  both finance and machine learning while potentially gaining insights into the dynamics of financial markets.

On Kaggle we found a Stock Dataset that the creator updated and had clean. We then used this data to help train our Machine so that it would learn a capture the trend that we needed it to so it would be able to accurately predict the outcome of the stock prices.

When we trained and created our Machine we also created a graph to see the data and keep track of the test data, training data, and actual data to know if it was successful.

We ran into issues after creating our machine and training it that we did not foresee happening, we had our model not really giving accurate readouts and would stagnant after a few readouts. After some research and conversations we reached the conclusion that the farther from the day you are the less accurate your prediction will become due to multiple factors like social media.

We started looking at all sorts of possible reasons and checking our R^2. After some research and a conversation with Ahmad we reached the conclusion that the farther from the current day. The less accurate your prediction will become due to multiple factors like social media.

Finding out this information led us to a very weird predicament that we didn't know the next steps to go for with our project. However, after some thinking Joshua came up with the idea, that because the data was being updated daily that we could take the data that the creator had added since we started the project and create a model that kept track and compared our models estimate for the next day and then giving it the actual so it could make the guess again. Leading to a better way for us to track if the data trend is being followed correctly.

We tried using the yfinance library. This library contained formulas to add moving averages, strength index, and a couple of ratios.This allowed us to basically add more features for the model to go off of, and enabled the machine to get a more accurate 1-day result for what would be todayâ€™s closing price

Conclusion:
In the end we tried many different libraries and used a lot of resources and research to look into the problems that we were having. We know that our Machine does not give a 100% readout but it does give a fairly good estimate and we think that if we had more access to more features we could make our estimate more and more accurate for each upcoming day.
